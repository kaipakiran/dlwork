But the author can evoke his and Merle's world (and what a world it is) so completely that, for the week or so I spent with this book, I was more in the wilds of Wyoming than in my own home. But it wasn't completely a pleasant experience for me; as a vegetarian, I found the author's description of his and Merle's hunting experiences hard to take at times, even though the descriptions were not graphic. But it is a wonderful book.\",\n",

       " \"T.C. Boyle is a great cultural and geographic observer, and does a wonderful job of writing about the characters and country that make this the great and entertaining State of California.  The descriptions of the bit players make me wonder if Carl Hiaasen took a road trip from Florida to help out a friend in California.The story is about the life and hardships of two Mexican immigrants to California, and the juxtaposition of their lives with the successful denizens of canyon country of North West Los Angeles County.The borders between the daily lives of the two families Boyle describes are more impenetrable than the Berlin Wall; but those borders of class and economic standing pale beside the gulf of misunderstanding between the two families.  But unlike the wall that kept the cold war protagonists apart, the families of Boyle's narrative meet, and those meetings often result in clashes that rip both families out of their accustomed patterns, and seldom in positive ways.  Boyle's description of the results of those meetings gives us some entertaining insight into his characters, and ourselves,Boyle's imagined and believable tale of struggle, defeat, hope, despair, achievement and failure is entertaining reading; and makes one think about values and humanity. For anyone who has lived in California, Boyle's observations of all of us ring true and reminds us that while we can impact the land, we probably can't conquer it and working together is the only way to survive.Sorry if I sound preachy.  The book is not.  It is a great read.  Buy it.\",\n",
       " 'A nice \"short\" read with cases to help me remember pathologies I might see on the general IM service and on the shelf exam. It is not comprehensive though, and I recommend a supplemental book as well. I tend to use the Blueprints series with Case Files, and I\\'ve taken a look at Step-Up-to-Medicine, and I think that is a good book to add to your studies as well. I like the Case Files series, because most of their books are available as e-books, so it\\'s nice when I have a short break to be able to use my kindle. The cases are short enough and easy to read that I don\\'t get disoriented when my reading is interrupted. I don\\'t think the Internal Medicine book is as e-reader friendly as the Family Medicine book. Family Medicine has more links I can use to move around, Internal Medicine does not. IM also seems to have more hiccups where the book would flip to a random page while I\\'m going through, making me lose my place. Family Medicine was not free from this plague, but with IM it seemed to happen more often.',\n",

She finds herself standing outside of her body trying desperately to comprehend what happened.  She is in a coma, suspended between life and death.  As her body lies mangled in the hospital and her extended family and friends rally to her side, she reviews her life and comes to realize that it's up to her to choose whether to stay or leave.  The book examines the many aspects of life and what family and love means.  This is one of those books that is almost impossible to put down.
